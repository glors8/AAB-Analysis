# 📊 User Behavior Analysis & A/A/B Test Evaluation

## Project Overview

This bootcamp project analyzes user interaction data from a food tech startup's mobile application. The primary objectives are to:

- Understand user behavior through the sales funnel.
- Evaluate the impact of a design change via an A/A/B test.

## 📈 Part 1: Sales Funnel Analysis

We examine event logs to understand user drop-offs and conversion rates through the funnel.

Key questions:
- Where do users abandon the funnel?
- How many reach the final purchase stage?
- What is the drop-off rate between stages?

---

## 🧪 Part 2: A/A/B Test Evaluation

A font redesign experiment divides users into:

- **Group 246 (Control A)**
- **Group 247 (Control A)**
- **Group 248 (Test B)**

The test helps determine:
- If the new font impacts user behavior.
- Whether differences between groups are statistically significant.

## 📁 Dataset Features

- `EventName`: Event type (e.g., view, click, purchase)
- `DeviceIDHash`: Unique user ID
- `EventTimestamp`: When the event occurred
- `ExpId`: Experiment group (246, 247 = control, 248 = test)
